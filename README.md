# CSGONftContracts

Simple smart contracts that emulate CSGO cases on the blockchain. Cases are claimed based on a rate of blocks and can be opened with a key. Keys can be bought for Eth or Matic and opened. When the cases is opened it uses chainlink VRF to get a random NFT and to generate a float value.
